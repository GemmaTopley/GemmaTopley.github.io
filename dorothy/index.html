      <h3>Bio: </h3>
      <p>
        Dorothy is a lady of leisure and enjoys the simpler things in life such as sleeping and sleeping and sometimes sleeping.
        Her least favourite thing is her little cousin Bonnie whose purpose in life seems to be to make her life hell by doing things such as stealing her sleep spots, 
        not allowing her to play with her toys and stealing her food.
        Her favourite toys are anything she can carry in her mouth as she loves to play fetch which she was taught how to do as a kitten.
